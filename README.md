Project using vanilla JS.

Play tic tac toe against an opponent on the same monitor. Current players are stored along with their scored which are displayed to either side of the board. 
Reset the board or add new players with the buttons at the head of the page.

To be added: better css styling or perhaps a connection to a database to store scores of past games
